Binds for using a 65% keyboard and a mouse with 4 side buttons.

Most binds are left as default, with a few changes to make it easier for those with non-standard layouts). Of course, binds will still work on any keyboard regardless of form factor, just be sure to check your boards manual/key locations for anything smaller than 65%.


## How to Import Binds/CFG using SC Launch Configurator

  1. Download and install [SC Launch Configurator](https://www.luftwerft.com/)
  2. Download `Sq65 Binds.profiles` in repo
  3. Open SC Launch Configurator
  4. Launch Star Citizen to confirm your profile is generated, then close Star Citizen
  5. In SC Launch Configurator, go to "Profile" and **BACKUP/EXPORT YOUR PROFILE**
  6. Import `Sq65 Binds.profiles` and install by clicking "LIVE" button to the right

If you change your binds/settings in-game, you can update and backup your new profile in the SC Launch Configurator.


**This profile is specific to my CFG/build, as I play on UW QHD. You may run the game with different settings in other menus (i.e. General, Audio, Graphics, etc). Please back up your settings before importing mine (see step 6 above). If your game does not launch due to errors in rendering/resolution, review your graphics settings either in-game or in the SC Launch Configurator.**
